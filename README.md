# Linux Kernel Experiments

This repository contains some of my experiments related to Linux kernel
development and exploitation. See the "README" in each relevant directory for
more info.

- [`modules/`](modules): test kernel modules written for educational purposes.
- [`userspace/`](userspace): test userspace programs written for educational
  purposes.
- [`myinit/`](myinit): barebones C init process to simply compile and drop into
  a QEMU testing environment.
- [`codeql/`](codeql): useful CodeQL queries that I've written while learning
  CodeQL.
